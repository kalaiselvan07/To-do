# TODO Microservices Setup

Welcome to the TODO microservices setup! This setup allows you to quickly deploy and run the TODO services using Docker and Docker Compose.

## Quick Start

**Prerequisite**: Ensure you have `Docker` and `Docker Compose` installed.

1. **Clone or download this repository**.
   
2. **Navigate to the directory** containing the `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. **Run the following command**:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

That's it! The images are already available on Docker Hub, so there's no need to build anything locally.

## Services

* **authn** - Authentication service.
* **authz** - Authorization service.
* **app** - Main application service.

Thank you for using the TODO microservices setup!
